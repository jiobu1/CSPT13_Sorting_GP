"""
One of the most straightforward problems we can solve recursively is to print every number from n down to zero
in succession. We can do that simply by writing a function that prints n, then calls itself for n-1:
"""
# import sys
import sys
sys.setrecursionlimit(10005)
N = 10000 # too large

n = 100

def countdown_i(n):
    # while loop version
    while (n > 0): # condition and label
        print(n) # body
        n -= 1 # decrement

def countdown(n): # label
    # condition (base case)
    if n == 0:
        return

    # body
    print(n)

    # decrement
    countdown(n-1)

# countdown_i(n)
# countdown(N)
countdown(n)
