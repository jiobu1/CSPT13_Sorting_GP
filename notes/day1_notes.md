![Big O](images/bigO.png)
- time is based on the complexity of the algorithm vs the real world time because of computing power etc


## Linear Search
- Linear search -> linear runtime O(n)

[0, 7, 4, 2, 9, 3, 12]
looking for a 2, searches a data structure linearly to fulfill a search query
- return idx?
- if you look for another number, you will have to start the search again.

## Binary Search
